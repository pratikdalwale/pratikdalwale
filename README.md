- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pratik a.k.a @theroamingfreak
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate. 
- ðŸŒ± I started Programming Journey Out of Curiosity, in order to understand the significance of various mechanical concepts(formulas), 
- simulate their outcomes and have a better understanding. Apart from that it is fun to play with codes.
